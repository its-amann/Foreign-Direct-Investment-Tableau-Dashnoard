# Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Analytics Project

## Overview
The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Analytics Project aims to provide insightful analysis and visualization of global FDI trends. This project leverages Tableau for data visualization and a CSV data source containing FDI-related metrics.

## Project Files
- **Foreign Direct Investment Analytics.twbx**: Tableau Workbook containing interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **FDI data.csv**: Source data file in CSV format containing FDI metrics and relevant economic indicators.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Explore FDI trends by country, sector, and year.
- **Data Visualizations**: Clear and insightful charts, maps, and graphs.
- **Custom Analysis**: Tailored metrics for business and policy insights.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
